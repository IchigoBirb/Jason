- Hi, I’m @IchigoBirb
- I started coding in Dec 2021
- My experience in coding so far is the basics of python (Poly Year 1 level)
- I’m currently learning python (pyautoGUI,schedule)
- I plan on learning (Soundmeter)
- How to reach me (Contact through whatsapp +65 8949 4839[Singapore])

I plan on making
- A script to take the transcript translation from zoom and check whether my name has been called and then send a ping to my phone
as well as the last 10 lines of transcripted words and those afterwards until the program is stopped manually.
(Maybe also immediately type in the chat ‘Sorry just came back from toilet’)

- A script to help search my github for [reusable code/resolved errors method] and if not, search using the google functions (Site:,’’ etc)
https://hellmuthbroda.com/2011/11/25/how-to-use-google-search-more-effectively-infographic/

- A application that integrates all the ‘programmes’ into functions so I can easily access them from my phone 
-Zoom transcript
-Search error for code
-Access my files that were auto organised
-Auto send message on whatsapp at specified time
-Play a shuffled song list with the option to set [soft/medium/loud]
-[To add on in the future]

- Organise my computer files into folders

- Auto send a message at a specific time/after a specific time in my whatsapp to a contact

- Imports my song list from youtube and shuffles them,and auto set the volume depending on 
whether the song is soft or loud to a [soft/medium/loud] volume (Use soundmeter to determine decibals)

- Auto screen record zoom meeting at a scheduled time
